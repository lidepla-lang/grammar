## The ordinal numerals

These are formed with the help of the particle “-ney”:

un-ney — first  
dwa-ney — second  
tri-ney — third  
char-ney — forth...  
shi-ney — tenth  
shi-un-ney — eleventh...  
sto-petshi-char-ney — one hundred fifty forth.

Replacing вЂ“ney with вЂ“nem gives adverbial forms:

un-nem — firstly; at first  
dwa-nem — secondly  
tri-nem — thirdly  
char-nem — in the forth place...  
shi-nem — in the tenth place  
shi-un-nem — in the eleventh place...  
sto-petshi-char-nem — in the one hundred fifty forth place.

## Numeral suffixes

•   **\-ka** — the suffix forming nouns from numerals. For example, "petka" may denote a bus number 5, or grade of "five" signifying "excellent", or a five-dollar note ("fiver"), etc. Such nouns are practical with rather small numbers, up to 100.

unka — one  
dwaka — two, deuce  
trika — three  
charka — four  
petka — five…  
shika — ten  
shi-dwaka — dozen  
dwashika — twenty  
trishika — thirty  
stoka — a hundred

•   **\-fen** —forms fractions:

un (de) dwafen — one half  
un trifen — one third  
charfen — a quarter  
sem shifen — seven tenths  
tri stofen — three hundredths  
pet otfen — five eighths.

Decimal fractions are pronounced with the help of the word _koma_ (comma):

tri koma pet — 3,5  
dwa koma semshi pet — 2,75

One can also say "dwa koma semshi pet stofen".

There is also a special word for "half":

haf — half  
un e haf — one and a half  
dwa e haf — two and a half

•   The suffix **\-ple**:

dwaple — double  
triple — triple  
charple — quadruple, etc.

In the adverbial form it becomes **\-plem**:

dwaplem — doubly  
triplem — triply

* * *

•   A noun after a numeral is not pluralized:

pet jen — five men  
tristo dolar — three hundred dollars  
sem pes sukra — seven pieces of sugar

•   A composite modifier "numeral + noun of measure + adjective":

tri metra glube riva — a river three meters deep  
Sey mur es dwa metra gao. — This wall is 2 meters high.  
_Govo, pagi-ney shi yar bak! — Trupa grauli. — Nu bu fai dela om osta kel es shi yar lao!_ — “A bull paid ten years ago!” the Pack snarled. “What do we care for bones ten years old?”

undi — Monday  
dwadi — Tuesday  
tridi — Wednesday  
chardi — Thursday  
petdi — Friday  
sitdi — Saturday  
semdi — Sunday

Names for months are based on Latin ones, which are spread very widely. However, compounds ("month"+number) are also acceptable:

February — februar (mes-dwa)  
March — marto (mes-tri)  
April — april (mes-char)
