## Consonants

**b**

like _b_ in _bar_

**ch**

like _ch_ in _cheers_

**d**

like _d_ in _duck_

**f**

like _f_ in _fish_

**g**

like _g_ in _groom_

**h**

like _ch_ in the German _Fach_ (recommended), or _h_ in _home_

**j**

like _j_ in _jack_

**k**

like _k_ in _cake_, aspirated

**l**

like _l_ in _love_

**m**

like _m_ in _mamma_

**n**

like _n_ in _nanny_

**p**

like _p_ in _papa_, aspirated

**r**

Any kind of rhotic sound will do. After a vowel it is to be pronounced, however articulated

**s**

like _s_ in _Sunday_. Between vowels it may be voiced to some degree

**sh**

like _sh_ in _shoe_

**t**

like _t_ in _type_, aspirated

**v**

like _v_ in _vale_ (also admissible like _w_ in _wall_)

**w**

like _w_ in _wall_

**z**

like _dz_ in _adze_

The combination _ng_ at the end of a word is pronounced as one sound: \[ŋ\] (like in _doing_) is preferred, but \[n\] is also possible. In the middle of a word this combination is read exactly as combination of _n_ plus _g_.

The letter _x_ denotes the combination of letters _ks_. Between vowels it is recommended to read it as the combination of letters _gs_. In the position before a consonant may be read as \[s\].

Double consonants are not used.

In some proper names one should read "sh" as two separate consonants, in such cases a delimitator ' is used: Mas'hadov.

## Vowels

**a**

like _a_ in _father_

**e**

like _e_ in _bell_

**i**

like _ea_ in _tea_

**o**

like _oa_ in _boat_

**u**

like _oo_ in _cool_

**The letter "y"**.

The letters _i_ and _y_ denote the same sound \[i\]. The use of _y_ basically indicates that the sound is not stressed: pyu \[piú\]. Besides, _y_ at the end of a word indicates that the word is not a verb: krai _to cry_ — skay _sky_.
