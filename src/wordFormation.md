# Word formation

LdP tends to keep words unchanged, so it basically uses either (hyphenated) particles or suffixes beginning with a consonant which are simply added to a word. We believe that this makes word structure clearer and understanding easier.

## Diminutive and augmentative particles and suffixes

There is an augmentative particle gro-, a diminutive particle -ki (these particles are hyphenated), an augmentative suffix "gron", and a diminutive suffix "kin".

The suffixes are used to make notions which qualitatively differ from the basic noun:

dom — house  
domkin — a house that is inherently small (cabin, hut)  
domgron — a house that is inherently large (mansion)

denta — tooth  
dentagron — tusk

barela — barrel  
barelakin — keg

As to the particles, they modify the meaning within the limits of a given quality; gro- is used before the modified word, -ki after it:

dom-ki — a little house  
gro-dom — a big house.

The suffixes are used to form nouns only, while the particles may be used with different parts of speech:

gro-danke — thank you very much  
gro-gran — huge  
gro-gao — very high  
lu gro-pi vodka kom akwa — he swills vodka like water  
gro-chifan — to guzzle, overeat  
zai gro-pluvi — it is pouring  
zai pluvi-ki — it drizzles  
treba chifan-ki — one should have a snack  
somni-ki — to take a nap

It should be noted that there is also an intensifying adverb "gro", so that the mentioned phrases may also be constructed as: lu pi vodka gro, kom akwa; chifan gro; zai pluvi gro.

"Gro" expresses a greater extent of augmentation/intensification, than "muy" (very):

muy hao! — very well!  
gro-hao! — great! excellent!

The particles may also be used with proper nouns:

Jon-ki — Johnny

## Particles _NEY, SHE_ and their derivatives

**ney** — genitive particle; modifier-making particle; with verbs denotes passive participle; makes ordinal numerals. Ex.:

mata — mother

rude-fas-ney jen — red-faced person

gran-oko-ney gela — big-eyed girl

un-ney — first  
un-nem — at first, firstly

ofensi-ney — offended, resentful  
ofensi-nem — resentfully

**she** — active participle marker:

ahfi — to hide, conceal  
ahfi-she — hiding

respekti — to respect  
respekti-she — respecting

**shem** — the adverbial form from -she:

respekti-she — respecting  
respekti-shem — respectfully

ahfi-she — hiding  
ahfi-shem — stealthily

dumi-she — thinking  
dumi-shem — thoughtfully, pensively

**sha** — suffix of doer:

milki — to milk  
milki-sha — milker (person)

kapti — to catch  
kapti-sha — catcher

kan — to look

## Compound words

In compound words the modifying word stands before the main word:

guntaim — working time  
flaifish — flying fish  
suryaflor — sunflower  
akwagarmiser — water-heater  
mauskapter — mouse trap  
lernikitaba — textbook  
sendijen — envoy  
saltikorda — skipping-rope

The adjective suffix -e may be dropped:

garibjen — stranger (garibe jen)  
platbota — flat-boat (plate bota)

## Shortenings for words with -ney, -nem, -shem

For nouns ending in Ca (where C is a consonant) one may shorten Ca-ney => Ce and Ca-nem => Cem, for example:

farka-ney => farke  
farka-nem => farkem

But if "ney" expresses the genitive, shortening may not be done: mata-ney kitaba (not "mate kitaba").

For polysyllabic i-verbs one may shorten Ci-ney => Cen and Ci-nem => Cem, for example:

ofensi-ney => ofensen  
ofensi-nem => ofensem

If no ambiguity arises, one may also shorten Ci-shem => Cem:

ahfi-shem => ahfem

The short forms are given in the dictionary in brackets after the full forms.

## Endearment forms

Endearment forms of names may be constructed by shortening and adding -i:

Robert => Robi  
Dimitri => Dimi  
Attilio => Ati  
Oxana => Oxi  
Natalia => Nati

Other cases:

mama => mami — mummy  
doga => dogi — doggie  
yunkota => yunkoti — kitty

These endearment forms differ from the forms with particle -ki, as the latters may express not only endearment but also diminution:

_doga-ki_ may mean any little dog while _dogi_ means the pet dog.
