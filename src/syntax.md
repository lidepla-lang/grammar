# Syntax

## Word order

Word order is direct:

subject — predicate — object.

This is natural for a language without case endings:

"lu vidi yu" means something quite different than "yu vidi lu".

Pronouns in unstressed form before verbs, as in Romance languages (e. g. "je t’aime"), are not used in LdP.

### Case particles

An accusative particle "**den**" placed before the object makes it possible to change its place, e. g. for the sake of emphasis:

> Me pren yabla — I take an apple.  
> Kwo yu pren? — What do you take?  
> Den yabla me pren! — I take _an apple_!

> Den sey flor me pri. – I like _this flower_.

> den dom sobre – above _the house_

The nominative particle is **da** (used only when necessary):

> Lubi da me. – I love.

Notice the difference between "da" and "den" below: 

> Mata samaji me sam hao kom **da** yu. – Mother understands me as well as you do.  
> Mata samaji me sam hao kom **den** yu. – Mother understands me as well as she understands you.

> Patra lubi ela puy kem **da** mata. – The father loves her more than the mother does.  
> Patra lubi ela pyu kem **den** mata. – The father loves her more than his mother.

It is possible to emphasize different parts of the sentence with these particles:

> Me lubi yu — **_I_** love you  
> Den yu me lubi — I love **_you_**  
> Lubi da me yu — I **_love_** you

## Interrogative sentences

There are two interrogative particles. One of them _(ob)_ is placed at the beginning of an interrogative sentence, the other _(ku)_ at the end or directly after the word to which it relates. It is practical to use "ob" with longer sentences and "ku" with shorter ones:

> Ob yu mog shwo a me, wo es zuy blise fanshop? — Can you tell me, where is the nearest food store?

> Yu lai ku? — Will you come?

> Me lai, hao ku? — I'll come, OK?

The particle "ob" also plays the role of the conjunction "whether":

> Me bu jan, ob lu es in dom. — I don't know whether he is at home.

While _ob_ relates to the whole clause, _ku_ may shift the interrogative emphasis to the word that stands before it:

> Yu ku lai? — Is it you who will come?

> Yu bu gun! — _Me ku bu gun?_ You don't work! — _Who, me?_

There is one more variant of building interrogative sentences: you repeat a verb placing the negative particle "bu" in the middle:

> Yu go-bu-go? — Are you going (or not)?

> Ye-bu-ye koy idea? — Are there any ideas?

There is no necessity to use special pronouns (as "anything" instead of "something" in English questions). A question word like "kwo" what or "kwel" which may be placed at the beginning of interrogative sentence, although it may not be the subject:

> Kwo yu dumi om to? — What do you think about it?

Subject-predicate inversion is allowed only in the case of “es”:

> Wo es may kalam? — Where is my pen?

The expression "isn't it?" is "bu ver?":

> Es hao filma, bu ver? — It's a good film, isn't it?

## Negative sentences

The negative particle "bu" is used in negative sentences:

> Me bu jan. — I don't know.  
> Bu is always placed before a tense particle:  
> Nu bu go. — We don't go.  
> Nu bu ve go. — We won't go.  
> Nu bu he go. — We didn't go.  
> Nu bu wud go. — We wouldn't go.

Multiple negations are allowed:

> Lu bu samaji nixa. — He doesn't understand anything.

## Compound sentences

When building compound sentences, the subject and predicate of each clause should be clearly marked off. There should not be infinitive phrases:

> Me yao ke yu go adar (not "Me yao yu go adar"). — I want you to go there.

> Me he vidi ke lu stan dar (not "Me he vidi lu stan dar"). — I saw him standing there.

### The construction with ke after a noun

A modifying group (containing subject) may be placed _after_ a noun and "ke":

> Boy **ke** yu vidi janmog gani gro-hao. – The boy that you see can sing beautifully.

> Dom **ke** nu jivi. — The house in which we live.

> Jen **ke** me shwo. — The man I am talking about.

> Dao **ke** yu go — The way you are going.

### The particles _ti, na_

The optional particles _ti_ and _na_ are used to delimitate semantic groups. _Ti_ is a marker of a noun group, _na_ marks an end of a semantic group:

> **Ti** yu vidi **na** boy janmog gani hao. – The boy that you see can sing well.

> In skay gao **ti** blan badal floti. — In the high sky white clouds float.

> Oli gwerjen kel akompani-te shefa **na** he tabahi. — All the warriors that accompanied the chief have perished.

The construction _ti... na_ allows to place subordinate clauses _before_ a noun:

> Me kwesti lu om **ti** lu jivi **na** planeta. — I asked him about the planet on which he lives.

> Me bu yao diskusi **ti** yu shwo **na** kwesta. — I don't want to discuss the question that you mention.

The first element `ti` may be dropped if no ambiguity arises:

> Ta jivi **na** planeta. — The planet on which he lives.

> Me dumi **na** kwesta. — The question I am thinking about.

> Eventi pa septemba **na** konferensa. — The conference to take place in September (or: The conference that has taken place in September).

The constructions with _ti... na_ and _ke_ let us avoid subordinating conjunctions.

## Topic subclauses

One of the ways of building a sentence is to mention the key word of your idea (topic) and then to comment on it:

> Sey winda, treba shanji it tanto kway kom posible. — This window, it should be changed as soon as possible.

> Sey aksham, ob yu sal go a koylok? — Are you going to go anywhere this evening?

## Adjectival predicative

In order to avoid ambiguity, by default the adjectival predicative relates to the nearest noun or pronoun:

> Lu pikti ela nude. — He is painting her naked. (She is naked, and he painting her.)

Here _nude_ relates to _ela_, not to _lu_. One can also indicate this with the apposition marker _to_ or the equivalent combination _kel es_:

> Lu pikti ela to nude. Lu pikti ela kel es nude.

One should note that in order to express another meaning — «He is painting her as naked» — one should use the preposition kom:

> Lu pikti ela kom nude.

## Impersonal sentences

Impersonal sentences do not have a subject:

> Pluvi. — It rains.

> Bikam-te klare ke treba akti kway. — It became clear that one should act quickly.

> Sembli ke problema fo diskusi yok. — It seems that there are no problems to discuss.

> Lai-te a may kapa ke... — It came to my mind that....

## Punctuation

Separated with commas are:

1) homogeneous parts of the sentence

2) various parenthetical or explanatory clauses. Separation of subordinate clauses is optional.
