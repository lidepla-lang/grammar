# Nouns

## Noun endings

Most nouns end in **\-a** or consonants (but, as a rule, not _'b', 'g'_ or _'d'_):

lingwa — language  
jiva — life  
kordia — heart  
vagon — carriage  
situasion — situation  
aksham — evening  
profesor — professor  
dwar — door  
nivel — level  
mes — month  
fish — fish  
chokolat — chocolate  
handak — ditch  
taraf — side

Nouns may end also in other vowels:

kino — cinema  
oko — eye  
shampu — shampoo  
madu — honey  
kafee — cafe  
shosee — highway  
mani — money  
gari — cart  
taxi — taxi  
chay — tea  
skay — sky

The word "ski" _ski, to ski_ has the same form as a noun and as a verb.

## The singular

The basic noun form does not convey the grammatical meaning of singularity. To specify singularity, use "un" (one) or the optional marker of the singular "ge" (piece, single item):

doga — dog/dogs  
un doga, doga-ge — one dog.

## Plurals

The basic noun form does not convey the grammatical meaning of singularity. To specify singularity, use "un" one. In order to specify plurality, the plural form of noun may be used. Its ending is **\-(e)s**. If a noun ends in a vowel, add **\-s**; otherwise add **\-es**:

lingwa — language/languages  
lingwas — languages

boy — boy/boys  
boys — boys

aksham — evening/evenings  
akshames — evenings

•   When speaking generally about a group or class of uniform objects, plural endings are not used:

Yan chi bush. — Sheep eat bushes.

Amiga sempre helpi. — A friend always helps.

Bobra es animal. — Beavers are animals.

•   After any indication of plurality (numerals; quantifiers like ‘mucho’ _many, much_, ‘kelke’ _several, some_, ‘shao’ _little_, ‘ambi’ _both_, ‘grupa de’ _a group of_, ‘menga de’ _a lot of_, ‘para’ _a pair of_; plural subject, personal pronouns 'nu' _we_, 'li' _they_), as a rule, plural endings are not used:

pet jen — five people

tristo dolar — three hundred dollars

trishi kilometra — thirty kilometers

mucho yar — many years

shao jen — few people

kelke pes sukra — some pieces of sugar

oli dey — all days

oli jen — all people

Sey jenta es hao guner. — These people are good workers.  
(_Jenta_ means _folk, (a particular group of) people_).

Li es may amiga. — They are my friends.

Luy amigas es studenta. — His friends are students.

Toy kelke rosa es jamile. — Those roses are beautiful.  
(_lit.:_ Those some roses are beautiful).

**A note:** plural endings may be used after “mucho” and “shao” in order to specify that countable objects are implied (in cases where a noun may be countable as well as uncountable):

shao ananas — few pineapples _or_ little of pineapple  
shao ananases — few pineapples  
shao de ananas — little of pineapple

mucho fish — many fishes _or_ much fish  
mucho fishes — many fishes  
mucho de fish — much fish.

•   In case of pair objects the plural endings are usually used:

okos — eyes  
labas — lips  
handas — hands  
plechas — shoulders.

## Sex indication

There is no grammatical gender. Animate nouns may be of both sexes:

doga — a dog (never mind whether male or female)

amiga — friend (generally)

gova — a bull or a cow (such notion is practical in plural form: govas — cows and bulls)

swina — a pig of any sex

gansa — a goose or a gander (gansas — geese).

If there is need to indicate sex, it may be done two ways.

The first, more frequent, way is the use of particles **‘man’** and **‘gin’**:

man-doga — male dog  
gin-doga — female dog

man-studentas — male students (‘studentas’ are students generally)

man-gova — bull  
gin-gova — cow

man-swina — boar.

Another, less frequent, way is the use of suffixes **\-o** for masculine and **\-ina** for feminine. If a noun ends in _\-a_, the latter is dropped, otherwise the suffix is simply added:

rega — king/queen  
rego — king  
regina — queen

dogo — male dog  
dogina — female dog

studento — male student  
studentina — female student

govo — bull  
govina — cow

swino — male pig  
swinina — female pig

ganso — gander  
gansina — female goose.

It is obvious that it is not always needed to indicate sex, so it is correct to say:

Ela es hao leker. — She is a good doctor.

Ela es hao amiga. — She is a good friend.

Juchka es pumbe doga. — Zhuchka is a silly dog.

•   In several cases different words are used for the male and female:

mata/patra — mother/father

oma/opa — grandmother/grandfather

docha/son — daughter/son

kindocha/kinson — granddaughter/grandson

tia/onkla — aunt/uncle

sinior/madam — sir/madam.

## Genitive

Genitive is formed with the particle **\-ney** (hyphenated):

sedey-ney sivilisasion — the today's civilization

mata-ney kitaba — mother's book

Alex-ney jaketa — the jacket of Alex.

## Nouns meaning action

The correspondence between noun's form and its meaning is basically the following:

**Nouns for other verbs**

Act and its manifestation/instance/result/resulting state

\-a

\-sa

**A note:** if verb ends in -i, that ending is replaced with -ing; in other cases -ing is added. The only exception is monosyllabic i-verbs (ski _to ski_, pi _to drink_ ): in their case -ing is added (skiing, piing).  
**An important remark:** "ng" in this suffix may be read simply as "n". The suffix is never stressed.

Further examples:

shuti — to shoot  
shuta — a shot  
shuting — shooting

gloti — to swallow  
glota — a swallow  
gloting — swallowing

kiki — to kick

lansi — to throw  
lansa — a throw  
lansing — throwing.

## The concretizing suffixes -(i)ka, -tura, -wat

**The suffix -(i)ka** has the meaning "object, thing, something concrete":

mole — soft  
molika — pulp

nove — new  
novika — something new, novelty

metal — metal  
metalka — a metal thing

brili — to shine  
brilika — something shining

ofni — to open  
ofnika — opener

plei — to play  
pleika — toy, plaything

Derivation: in adjectives ending in -e and nouns ending in -a, this last vowel is transformed into -ika; in other cases -ka is added. With monosyllabic i-verbs, -ika is added with a hyphen:

ski — ski-ika  
pi — pi-ika.

It should be reminded that the ending -ika is unstressed.

On the whole, one can regard this suffix as an equivalent of "kosa" (thing) or "koysa" (something). Thus the suffix -(i)ka is polysemantic, the exact meaning of a word following from the context. In order to be more precise, one can use the suffixes -er (tool, device), -tura (stresses the result, product of action), or -wat (indicates the object of action).

**The suffix -tura** denotes an end result/product of action:

produkti — to produce  
produktura — produce, output

mixi — to mix  
mixitura — mixture

solvi — to dissolve  
solvitura — solution

texi — to weave  
texitura — fabric, tissue

sekwi — to follow  
sekwitura — consequence

derivi — to derive  
derivitura — derivative

shwo — to say  
shwotura — saying

Derivation: just added to a verb, however -titura=> -tura, -ditura=> -dura. NB: In some words like ‘temperatura’, ‘natura’ ‘tura’ is not a suffix.

**The suffix -wat** denotes object of action:

pi — to drink  
piwat — beverage

chi — to eat  
chiwat — food, eaten things

rosti — to roast  
rostiwat — roast (meat)

sendi — to send  
sendiwat — something sent

konteni — to contain  
konteniwat — contents

Derivation: just added to a verb.

One can distinguish between mixiwat (something mixed, an ingredient) and mixitura (mixture, a result of mixing), solviwat (dissolved thing) and solvitura (resulting solution).

## The suffixes of doer and tool

**The suffix -er** means both doer (person) and tool/ device/appliance.

When added to a verb, the final -i of the verb is dropped (except for the monosyllabic verbs ending in -i). When added to a noun, the final -a of the noun is dropped. In other cases -er is just added:

kapti — to capture, catch  
kapter — trap or trapper/catcher

lekti — to read  
lekter — reader (person or device)

vendi — to sell  
vender — seller

kondukti — to conduct (heat etc.)  
kondukter — conductor

zwo — to do  
zwoer — doer

shwo — to speak  
shwoer — speaker

ofni — to open  
ofner — opener

banka — bank  
banker — banker

ski — to ski  
skier — skier

politika — politics  
politiker — politician

milka — milk  
milki — to milk  
milker — milker (person or device)

historia — history  
historier — historian

plei — play  
pleier — player (person or device)

milion — million  
milioner — millionaire

yuwel — jewel  
yuweler — jeweller

To specify the meaning of doer, the suffix **\-sha** may be used which is derived from the active participle marker _\-she_; it is used only with verbs:

milki — to milk  
milki-sha — milker (person)

plei — to play  
plei-sha — player (person)

lekti — to read  
lekti-sha — reader (person)

kapti — to catch  
kapti-sha — catcher

To specify the meaning of tool/ device/appliance, one may use the suffixes -(i)ka (see above) or compound words with **tul** (_tool, instrument_):

ofni — to open  
ofnika — opener

plei — play  
pleika — toy, plaything

vinti — to screw  
vintitul — screwdriver

komuniki — to communicate  
komunikitul — means of communication

**The suffix -ista** denotes a person in relation to a certain doctrine (‘ism’) or profession:

komunista — communist  
metodista — methodist  
dentista — dentist  
artista — artist  
spesialista — specialist

This suffix is basically applied to other nouns.

**The words ending in -or, -ator.**

LdP also imports common European words ending in -or, -ator which mean either doer or tool:

kalkulator — calculator  
ventilator — ventilator  
aktor — actor  
direktor — director  
profesor — professor

NB: Not every word meaning a tool must have a suffix. Many verbs are derived from tool-nouns: 'hamri' _to hammer_ from 'hamra' _hammer_.

## Abstract nouns meaning quality

Abstract nouns meaning quality (as such) are formed with the suffixes -nesa and -(i)taa:

feble — weak  
feblenesa — weakness

dule — tender  
dulenesa — tenderness (-nesa is simply added)

diverse — diverse  
diversitaa — diversity

probable — probable  
probablitaa — probability

amiga — friend  
amigitaa — friendship

If a word ends in the vowel e/a, it is transformed into -itaa. For adjectives like ‘gao, lao’ and those ending in a consonant the suffix has the form -taa:

shao — little (in quantity)  
shaotaa — scarcity

karim — kind, good  
karimtaa — kindness

donishil — generous  
donishiltaa — generosity

•   The suffix **\-(i)taa** differs in that the nouns formed with it have a broader meaning: not only that of quality but also that of a particular phenomenon connected with this quality:

reale — real  
realenesa — realness  
realitaa — reality (world)

gao — high  
gaonesa — highness  
gaotaa — height

vere — true  
verenesa — trueness  
veritaa — truth

•   The suffix **\-nesa** also derives from verbs nouns with the meaning of the state which results from the action (-edness) or is otherwise connected with action:

adapti — to adapt  
adaptinesa — adaptedness

koni — be acquainted with  
koninesa — acquaintance

godi — be fitted/suited (for)  
godinesa — suitability, fitness

•   **A special case.**

For adjectives which are longer than 2 syllables and end in -ente or -ante, abstract nouns end in _\-ensia_ or _\-ansia_ correspondingly:

presente — present  
presensia — presence

abundante — abundant  
abundansia — abundance

## Other suffixes

## Names of countries, peoples and languages

Names of countries are written with a capital letter and are close to how they sound in the official language of the country:

Espania — Spain  
Jungwo — China  
Portugal — Portugal  
Rusia — Russia  
Nipon — Japan  
Doichland — Germany  
Frans — France  
Ingland — England.

In case the country has two names or two official languages, it may have also an alternative name, especially if those names are not similar to each other:

Suomi / Finland — Finland  
Bharat / India — India

But:

Belgie — Belgium (based on Dutch, the country's name in the two other official languages, German and French, sounds similar).

Composite names are translated into LdP:

Unisi-ney Statas de Amerika (USA) — The United States of America.

A compound word from country's name and 'jen' (man) denotes an inhabitant/subject of the country (written with a hyphen):

Suomi-jen — an inhabitant of Finland  
Rusia-jen — an inhabitant of Russia  
Jungwo-jen — an inhabitant of China  
USA-jen — a person living in the USA

These compound words should not be mixed with words for etnicity (a Russian, a Finn).

For ethnicity and the corresponding language a special word is used. It is close to how people refer to themselves. It plays the role of noun as well as adjective. "jen" and "lingwa" may be used for precision. Examples:

**ruski** — Russian; a Russian; the Russian language

me es ruski (jen) — I am Russian  
me shwo ruski (lingwa) — I speak Russian  
ruski fabula — a Russian fairy tale

**inglish** — English; an Englishman/-woman; the English language:

me bu shwo inglish — I don't speak English

**doiche** — German; a German; the German language:

doiche exaktitaa — German punctuality

**amerikan** — American (expressing the culture and national values of the USA); an American:

fama-ney amerikan poeta — a famous American poet  
ta es amerikan, ta shwo inglish — he/she is American; he/she speaks English

**espaniol** — Spanish; a Spaniard; the Spanish language

**portuges** — Portuguese; a Portuguese; the Portuguese language:

me shwo espaniol, yoshi me samaji portuges — I speak Spanish; also I understand Portuguese

**han** — Chinese (ethnic); a Chinese; the Chinese language

Ta es han (jen), ta shwo han (lingwa). — He/she is a Chinese; he/she speaks Chinese.

Me es Jungwo-jen, bat me bu es han (jen). — I live in China, but I am not a Chinese.

**hindi** — Hindu (ethnic); a Hindu (ethnic); Hindi

**suomen** — Finnish; a Finn; the Finnish language

**ukrainska** — Ukrainian; a Ukrainian; the Ukrainian language

ukrainska-ruski lexikon — a Ukrainian-Russian dictionary

**nihon** — Japanese; a Japanese; the Japanese language

**romale** — Gipsy; a Gipsy; the Gipsy language:

jamile romale gana — a beautiful Gipsy song.

A hint on how to pronounce proper names:

If a proper name ends in several consonants and produces a difficult consonant cluster together with a following word, it's recommended to insert a neutral sound (which however isn't written).

For example, it's recommended to pronounce:

_Doichland-jen_

as if it were written

_Doichlanda-jen._
