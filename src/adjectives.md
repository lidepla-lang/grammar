# Adjectives

## Adjective endings

Most of adjectives end in -e:

forte — strong  
basike — basic  
gamande — haughty

or (if derived from nouns) in -ney:

sekret — secret  
sekret-ney — secret, confidential

abyas — habit  
abyas-ney — habitual

Besides, there are adjectives some ending in -an:

blan — white  
gran — big  
suan — sore

some ending in -ao (of Chinese origin):

hao — good  
gao — high  
syao — little (in size)  
lao — old

some ending in -im (of Arabic origin):

muhim — important  
karim — kind, good  
rahim — merciful

also some adjective suffixes (-ful, -lik, -shil, -val) end in a consonant:

joisaful — joyful  
ginalik — womanly  
gunshil — industrious

Then there are some adjectives ending in -u and -y:

blu — blue  
kway — quick.

The final –е of adjectives may be dropped if this doesn't complicate pronunciation:

jamile, jamil – beautiful  
dine, din – thin.

## Nouns and adjectives

One may qualify an object by placing a noun before another noun:

lingwa kanunes — language laws  
akwa sportas — water sports  
westa feng — western wind

A noun with the modifier-making particle -ney becomes an adjective:

Sey feng es westa-ney. — This wind is western.

Other ways of qualifying an object are:

1) using the preposition 'de':

kanunes de lingwa — laws of language

2) using the preposition 'do' which introduces a specific characteristic or purpose of an object that may be described in several words:

gela do grin okos — green-eyed girl  
okula do surya — sun glasses  
jen do lignagamba — a man with a wooden leg  
es kosa do ridi — this is ridiculous

## Adjective suffixes

The suffixes **\-ale** and **\-are** have a general meaning. They are taken ready-made into LdP together with common European words (as a rule, abstract ones) and are not productive. They are very rare among most frequent words; one can mention among the latter only the following:

kordia — heart  
kordiale — cordial

sentra — centre  
sentrale — central

The suffix **\-ike** (unstressed) derives adjectives which mean _'relating or pertaining to this noun'_:

osean — ocean  
oseanike — oceanic  
sistema — system  
sistemike — pertaining to system  
fanata — fanatic  
fanatike — fanatical  
harmonia — harmony  
harmonike — harmonious  
historia — history  
historike — historical

If added to a noun ending in -a or -ia, those endings are dropped. Nouns ending in -ika produce adjectives ending in -ike:

publika — publike  
gramatika — gramatike

The suffix-particle **ke** derives adjectives of relation from verbs or from word groups containing verbs. With polysyllabic i-verbs hyphens are not used:

kompari — compare  
komparike — related to comparing, comparative

vidi — see  
vidike — related to seeing, visual

audi — hear  
audike — related to hearing, auditory

shwo — speak  
shwo-ke — related to speaking

festi — celebrate

mucho-shwo-ke bashan — a wordy speech

sempre-snegi-ke meteo — a weather of perpetual snowing  
shao-pluvi-ke klima — a climate of little rain

hao-audi-ke musika — a music that is good to hear  
hao-chi-ke fan — a food that is nice to eat  
hao-yusi-ke sikin — a handy knife  
hao-lekti-ke kitaba — a book that is easy or interesting to read

The suffix **\-tive** means 'doing or capable of doing, connected with doing'. It is added to a verb, then -titive=>-tive, -sitive=>-sive:

puni — punish  
punitive — punitive

nutri — nourish  
nutritive — nutritive

akti — to act  
aktive — active

konvinsi — to convict  
konvinsive — convincing

sugesti — to suggest  
sugestive — suggestive

atrakti — to attract  
atraktive — attractive

exklusi — to exclude  
exklusive — exclusive

explosi — to explode  
explosive — explosive

The suffix **\-lik** means "characteristic of, similar in appearance or character":

matalik — maternal, motherly  
amigalik — friendly  
manlik — manly  
ginalik — womanly  
domlik — homely, cozy  
suryalik — sun-like

The suffix **\-ful** means "possessing (esp. in great quantity), full of":

joisaful — joyful  
jivaful — lively, sprightly, vivacious  
lumaful — spotlit, luminous, alight  
misteriaful — mysterious  
danjaful — dangerous

The suffix **\-bile** corresponds to '-able, -ible':

samaji — samajibile _understandable_  
vidi — vidibile _visible_  
audi — audibile _audible_  
persepti — perseptibile _perceptible_  
chi — chibile _edible_

The suffix **\-ish** means "to some extent, somewhat, moderately":

blan — white  
blanish — whitish

interes-ney — interesting  
interes-nish — more or less interesting

hao — good  
haoish — passable

When adding this suffix, the final -e of adjectives or -a of nouns is dropped; -ney => -nish.

The suffix **\-shil** means "having inclination or tendency to":

gun — to work  
gunshil — industrious

kusi — to bite  
kusishil — tending to bite

fobi — to fear  
fobishil — timorous

The suffix **\-val** means "worthy":

admirival — admirable  
sey filma es goval — this film is worth going to see  
sey geim es pleival — this game is worth playing

## Substantivation of adjectives and participles

•   The particle **'lo'** imparts to the adjective the meaning "that which is, things that are":

lo hao — the good, what is good  
lo buhao — the bad, what is bad  
lo resta-ney — the rest  
lo vidi-ney — the seen, what is seen  
lo vendi-ney — the sold, what is sold  
lo sekwi-she — what follows  
lo shwo-ney — the said  
Lo tal bu mus repeti. — Such a thing must not happen again (repeat).

This particle may be dropped if there is another qualifier:

olo uuparen-shwo-ney — everything above-said  
olo jamile — everything beautiful

•   If the adjective has the suffix -e, changing it to -a produces a noun with the meaning “something or somebody characterized with this quality”:

yunge — young  
yunga — young man/woman (yungo _young man_, yungina _young woman_)

saje — wise  
saja — sage

jamile — beautiful  
jamila — beautiful woman/handsome man (jamilo _handsome man_, jamilina _beautiful woman_)

garibe — alien, extraneous  
gariba — stranger

konstante — constant (adj.)  
konstanta — constant (noun)

absolute — absolute (adj.)  
absoluta — absolute (noun)

This transformation may not be applied to shortenings of words with -ney (see _"Shortenings for words with -ney, -nem, -shem"_)

•   Using the pronoun _wan_ (“an individual, one”) has a similar effect:

adulte — adult (adj.)  
adulte wan — adult (noun)

Kapti-ney wan bu shwo-te nixa. — The captured (person) did not say anything.

•   Adjectives with plural endings are used in the role of nouns:

Flori ba, yunges! — Bloom, young ones!

Koys go-te a desna, otres a lefta. — Some went to the right, others to the left.

Om morta-neys gai shwo sol hao. — Speak only good of the dead.

•   The particle “la”, in plural “las” (written with a hyphen) placed after adjective or participle may be optionally used as a substantivator or a substitute word, in order to avoid repetition of the same noun:

Hir ye kelke rosa, ob yu preferi blan-las o hwan-las? — Hwan-las.  
There are roses here; do you prefer the white or the yellow ones? — The yellow.

Walaa dwa kitaba. Sey-la es hao e toy-la es buhao. — Here are two books. This one is good, and that one is bad.

## Place in a sentence

The adjective usually precedes the noun. However, to stress it or to add a poetic connotation it may be placed after the noun: you may say "She has large blue eyes" either as

  
"Ela hev gran blu okos" **_or_**

"Ela hev okos gran blu" **_or_**

"Ela hev gran okos blu".

## Verbs from adjectives

The prefix mah- or suffix -isi mean "to make, render, transform into, bring into a condition":

garme — hot  
mah-garme, garmisi — heat up  
lenge — cold  
mah-lenge, lengisi — cool

The prefix fa- or suffix -ifi mean "to get, to become":

garme — hot  
fa-garme, garmifi — get hot, heat up  
lenge — cold  
fa-lenge, lengifi — get cold, cool down.

The suffix -fai makes verbs with meaning "to be such or act correspondingly":

hwan — yellow  
hwanfai — appear/show yellow

podle — mean, base  
podlefai — act meanly, behave like a scoundrel

dule — tender  
dulefai — act in a tender way, indulge in caresses.

•   It is acceptable to derive verbs with the suffix -i from adjectives, under the following conditions:

1) the meaning of verb is clear from the context;

2) one should not derive nouns in -a from such verbs. Such verbs may be transitive as well as intransitive. Examples:

topale — lame  
lu topali — he limps  
topaling — limping, lameness

garme — hot  
lu garmi akwa — he heats up water  
akwa zai garmi — the water is heating up  
garming — heating

tayar — ready  
ela tayari sabahfan — she prepares breakfast  
fan zai tayari — the food is preparing  
tayaring — preparation.

Wherever ambiguity is possible, use -isi, -ifi or -fai.
