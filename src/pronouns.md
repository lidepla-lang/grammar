ta (lu, ela)  
it

li

me — I  
yu — you (sg., pl.)  
ta — he, she, it (common for animate)  
lu — he  
ela — she  
it — it (inanimate)  
nu — we  
li — they

## Pronoun _yu_

General pronoun for 2nd person. If it's necessary to stress that you address a group, not a single person, you can use combinations like “yu oli” _(you all)_, “yu ambi” _(you both)_, “yu tri” _(you three)_. Also it's possible to use "yu un" _(you one)_ to clarify that you've switched from a group to an individual.

## Pronoun _ta_

General pronoun for animate objects in 3rd person singular:

Kwo ta shwo? — _What does he/she say?_

Me vidi ta. — _I see him/her_ (or an animal).

Es doga. Ta nami Sharik — _It's a dog. Its name is Sharik_.

This pronoun can be used instead of _lu_ and _ela_, which is comfortable for native speakers of languages without genders and special pronouns for "he" and "she" (e. g., Chinese, Finnish). Besides, it is convenient to use this pronoun in situations when the gender of a person is not defined exactly:

Es sempre hao si jen jan kwo ta yao. — _It is always good when a man_ (or it may be a woman as well) _knows what he/she wants._

## Pronoun _it_

The pronoun _it_ relates to inanimate objects:

Se es auto. It go kway. — This is a car. It goes fast.

_It_ does not have the meaning "this, that" (as reference to the actions, conditions or events mentioned in the preceding or following statement); these meanings are expressed by pronouns "se" (this) and "to" (that):

Me jan to. — I know that. ("Me jan it" would mean "I know it (something inanimate)").

## Declension of personal pronouns

Personal pronouns are invariable:

Me jan ke yu lubi me. — I know that you love me.

Me dumi mucho om yu. — I think much about you.

Ob yu dumi-te mucho om me? — Did you think much about me?

Ela lubi lu. — She loves him.

Lu lubi ela. — He loves her.

The dative case is marked with the preposition "a":

Dai a me sey kitaba, plis! — Give me please this book!

Me dai sey kitaba a ela. — I give this book to her.

Lu diki a nu luy nove bao. — He shows us his new bag.

Dai a li pyu taim. — Give them more time.

## Possessive forms of personal pronouns

These may be regularly derived with the help of the particle “ney”:

me-ney

nu-ney

yu-ney

yu-ney  
yu-oli-ney

ta-ney  
lu-ney  
ela-ney  
it-ney

li-ney

But there are also shorter forms:

may

nuy

yur

yur

suy (luy, elay)  
suy

ley

may — my

yur — your (sg., pl.)

suy — its, his, her, one's (general for 3rd person singular)

luy — his

elay — her

nuy — our

ley — their

_Suy_ is the universal possessive pronoun for the 3rd person singular. It can be used instead of ta-ney, lu-ney, ela-ney, it-ney:

Suy jamile okos. — His/her beautiful eyes.

Es auto, suy kolor es rude. — This is a car, its colour is red.

It is natural to use "suy" or "ta-ney" in situations when the gender of a person is not specified:
