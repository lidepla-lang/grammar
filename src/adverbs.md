# Adverbs

•   Adverbs of manner are formed from adjectives by changing -e to -em:

klare _clear_ — klarem _clearly_.

If the adjective ends in a consonant, -em is added:

santush _satisfied, contented_ — santushem _contentedly_.

In other cases the adverb has the same form:

hao — good; well  
kway — quick; quickly

•   Adverbs may be derived from nouns and verbs with "-nem" (from -ney) or "-shem" (from -she):

amiga — friend  
amiga-ney — friend's, friendly  
amiga-nem — in a friendly way

rega — king/queen  
rega-ney — king's/queen's, kingly/queenly, regal  
rega-nem — regally

ofensi — to offend  
ofensi-ney — offended, resentful  
ofensi-nem — offendedly  
ofensi-she — offensive  
ofensi-shem — in offensive way

respekti — to respect  
respekti-she — respecting  
respekti-shem — in respecting way, respectfully

grumbli — to grumble  
grumbli-she — grumbling  
grumbli-shem — grumblingly

ahfi — to hide, conceal  
ahfi-shem — stealthily.

•   Underived adverbs may end differently:

poy — then, later  
wek — away  
uupar — up  
for — further, on, forth.

•   Here are some spatial and temporal adverbs and prepositions:

avan — forward (_where to?_)  
avanen — ahead (of) (_at what place?_)  
aus — out (_where to?_)  
ausen — outside (_at what place?_)  
bak — back(wards)  
baken — behind  
in — in  
inu — into  
inen — inside;  
a flanka — sideways  
flanken — on one side  
a lefta — to the left  
leften — at the left (of)  
a desna — to the right  
desnen — at the right (of)  
nich — down(wards)  
nichen — down (_at what place?_)  
uupar — up(wards)  
uuparen — up (_at what place?_)  
miden — in the middle of  
afte — after  
aften — afterwards, later on  
bifoo — before  
bifooen — formerly

One can see that the spatial adverbs expressing movement towards a certain point end in different ways, while those expressing being in (at) a certain point end in -en (this ending is unstressed).

•   Some adverbs are composed of (abridged) words:

kadalok — everywhere  
enitaim — anytime  
koygrad — to some extent

•   The preposition _**pa**_ (of a wide meaning) introduces an adverbial phrase:

pa fortuna — fortunately  
pa aksham — in the evening  
pa un-ney kansa — by first sight  
shwo pa LdP — speak LdP
