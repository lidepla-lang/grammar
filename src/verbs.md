# Verbs

## Verb types

There are two verb types:

i-verbs (type 1) and other verbs (type 2).

i-verbs are the verbs that end in _consonant+i_, e. g.:

vidi — to see  
audi — to hear  
fini — to finish  
sidi — to sit  
dumi — to think  
fobisi — to frighten  
pri — to like  
chi — to eat  
pi — to drink.

Monosyllabic i-verbs like _pri, chi, pi_ constitute a specific subtype characterized by that in derivation their -i is always preserved, e. g.:

chi — chier, chiing  
pi — pier, piing

(cf.: swimi — swimer, swiming).

Examples of type 2 verbs:

jan — to know  
gun — to work  
zun — to be occupied with, devote oneself to  
shwo — to say, to speak  
go — to go  
yao — to want  
lwo — to fall  
flai — to fly  
krai — to cry  
prei — to pray  
joi — to rejoice, be happy  
jui — to enjoy, revel in  
emploi — to employ  
kontinu — to continue.

Verbs with prefixes **fa-** and **mah-**, which contain adjectives, are type 2 verbs too:

fa-syao — to diminish, become smaller (syao _small_)  
fa-muhim — to become more important (muhim _important_)  
mah-hao — make better, improve (hao _good_).

## The main verb form

This is the only verb form that one has to memorize. It is used in all cases, with particles or adverbs added for clarity when needed.

Examples:

treba dumi — one should think  
me (yu, ta, nu, yu, li) dumi — I (you, he/she, we, you, they) think  
Dumi! — Think!  
Me yao ke yu dumi hao om to. — I'd like you to think well about it (“I want that you think well about it”).

Tu samaji es tu pardoni. — To understand is to forgive.  
Es taim fo samaji ke... — It's time to understand that...  
Nu samaji se. — We understand this.  
Samaji! — Understand!  
Wud bi muy hao, si yu samaji ke... — It would be very good if you understand that…

Tu go a kino es hao. — It is good to go to the cinema.  
Lu sal go a kino. — He is going to go to the cinema.  
Lu go a kino. — He goes (or is going) to the cinema.  
Go ahir! — Go here!  
Me nadi ke yu go a kino. — I hope that you go to the cinema.

**Negation** is formed by means of the particle **bu** placed before a verb or tense particle:

Me bu samaji. — I don't understand.  
Lu bu yao. — He doesn't want.  
Bu go dar! — Don't go there!  
Bu shwo ke yu bu jan-te! — Don't say that you didn't know!

## Verb forms

Verb forms are basically the main verb form plus a particle before or after the verb. If a particle comes after the verb, it is written with a hyphen. Thus, the main verb form is always evident, and its stress is preserved.

Particles _**before the verb**_:

**ve** — future tense marker;

**he** — past tense marker

**zai** — marker of continuous aspect

**wud** — conditional marker

**gwo** — remote past tense marker (_some time ago, earlier in life, have been to somewhere or used to do something_)

**sal** — immediate future marker (_to be about to do something._)

**yus** — immediate past marker (_have just done something_; the word _yus_ means _just_)

**gei** — marks the passive of becoming.

Particles _**after the verb**_:

**\-te** — past tense marker

**\-she** — present active participle marker

**\-yen** — verbal adverb marker, "while -ing"

**\-ney** — passive participle marker, or (for intransitive verbs) past active participle marker.

Examples:

chi — to eat

ve chi — will eat

chi-te, he chi — ate or have eaten

zai chi — is eating

ve zai chi — will be eating

zai chi-te — was eating

ve he chi — will have eaten

he chi-te — had eaten

wud chi — would eat

wud chi-te — would have eaten

gei chi — is being eaten

ve gei chi — will be being eaten

gei-te chi — was being eaten

es chi-ney — is eaten

bin chi-ney — was eaten

ve bi chi-ney — will be eaten

chi-she — eating (active part.):

chi-she kota — the eating cat

chi-yen — (while) eating (verbal adverb)

afte chi — having eaten

gwo chi — used to eat, has experience of eating

sal chi — about to eat

yus chi-te — have just eaten.

## Future tense

Examples:

me ve shwo — I shall say (speak)

nu ve go — we shall go

ela ve lekti — she will read

yu ve gun — you will work

ve pluvi — it will rain

me bu ve go — I won't go.

## Past tense

There are 2 particles for the past tense: _he_ (before verb) means the completed action, _\-te_ (after verb) means the past tense for any action, completed or not:

He pluvi. — It has rained (and stopped).  
Pluvi-te. — It rained _or_ It has rained _or_ It has been raining.

When _\-te_ and _he_ are used together, they are equal to the English past perfect tense:

Wen lu lai-te a dom, ela he kuki-te akshamfan — When he came home, she had cooked supper.

The combination of _ve_ with _he_ is equal to the English future perfect tense:

Wen lu ve lai a dom, ela ve he kuki akshamfan. — When he comes home, she will have cooked supper.

•   The verb **"bi"** _to be_ is special, and it has the past form _bin_:

Wo yu bin? — Where were you? Where have you been?

## Imperative mode

To stress the imperative meaning, or to make it clearer, the particle ‘ba’ may be used after verb:

Go ba dar! — Go there!  
Kan ba hir! — Look here!  
Nu go ba! — Let's go!  
Nu begin ba! — Let's begin!  
Ta lai ba! — Let him come!

There is also the particle ‘hay’ (‘may, let’) expressing a wish or permission:

Hay olo bi hao! — May everything be good!  
Hay forsa bi kun yu! — May the force be with you!  
Hay oni shwo to ke oni yao. — Let them say what they like.

The negative imperative is formed with 'bu' or with a special particle **'bye'**:

Bu go! Bu go ba! — Don't go!  
Boh bye lasi! — God forbid!

## Continuous aspect

It is marked by ‘zai’ before the verb:

Me zai go fon shop. — I am going from the shop.

Nau lu zai gun om se. — Now he is working on this.

Me zai go-te fon shop, wen me miti-te lu. — I was going from the shop when I met him.

Ob yu es libre manya klok dwa? Manya klok dwa me ve zai lekti kitabas in kitabaguan. — Are you free tomorrow at 2? Tomorrow at 2 I shall be reading books in the library.

The use of ‘zai’ is not obligatory. It is used only if the continuous aspect of action should be stressed.

## Present active participle

Formed with **\-she**:

Tuza sidi-she in bush ek-salti aus e lopi kway-kway nich kolina. — A hare sitting in the bush jumped out and ran very quickly down the hill.

•   Basically the same meaning is conveyed through the suffix **\-anta**, which some nouns in LdP have:

komersi — to trade  
komersanta — trader  
kolori — to color  
koloranta — colorant  
konsulti — to consult  
konsultanta — consultant

But these words are not active participles, they are nouns with their own meaning.

•   Instead of active participles, constructions with _**kel**_ may be used:

Tuza kel sidi in bush. — The hare that is sitting in the bush.

Constructions with _**kel**_ are preferable when a direct object is involved:

Kota kel chi fish. — The cat that eats fish.

## Verbal adverb

This is formed with **\-yen**:

vidi-yen — seeing  
jan-yen — knowing.

•   It should be noted that simultaneity of actions may be also expressed through the preposition _al_ (at, in the process of):

Al pasi bus-stopika me he vidi ke ela stan dar. (=Pasi-yen bus-stopika…) — Passing by the bus- stop I saw her standing there.

Al vidi lu me krai-te: _Namastee!_ (=Vidi-yen lu…) — Seeing him I cried: ‘Hello!’

•   Constructions “afte + verb”, “al he + verb” mean “having done something”:

afte vidi — having seen  
afte smaili — having smiled  
afte audi — having heard

Afte audi om se, me he desidi miti lu. — Having heard about this, I decided to meet with him.

Al he zin shamba, me depon shapa. — Having entered the room, I took off my hat.

## Conditional tense

This is formed with the help of particle _wud_ in both main and subordinate clauses:

Me wud yao audi farke opinas. — I'd like to hear different opinions.

Yu wud mog zwo to si yu wud yao. — You could do that if you'd like to.

Me wud go adar si me wud hev taim. — I would go there if I had time.

Yeri me wud go-te adar si me wud hev-te taim. — Yesterday I would have gone there if I had time.

Me bu wud go adar. — I wouldn't go there.

The particle _wud_ may be shortened to _'d_:

Me'd go. = Me wud go.

## The immediate future and past

These are the constructions “to be about to do something” and “to have just done something”. The first one is “sal + verb”, the second is “yus + verb in past tense”:

Me sal chifan. — I am going to have a meal.  
Me yus he chifan. — I have just had a meal.  
Ta sal go a skola. — he (she) is about to go to school.  
Ta yus he lai. — He (she) has just come.

## Remote past tense

The remote past tense is formed with “gwo + verb” and expresses some action as a fact of the indefinitely remote past, which is connected with the present moment only in terms of having the corresponding experience. This is something that was taking place or used to take place some time ago:

Me gwo bi in Paris. — I have been to Paris.

Me gwo jivi in Paris. — I used to live in Paris.

Me gwo flai kelkem kadalok in munda. — I have flown everywhere in the world.

Me gwo audi musika de Prokofiev. — I have heard music by Prokofiev (I have had such an experience).

Ta gwo zun sporta. — He used to go in for sports.

Me bu gwo vidi ta. — I have never seen him before.

## Tense marking

There are 2 variants of tense marking in LdP: **_the full and the simple one._**

The _full variant_ is when you mark verb tense according to sense and without tense concordance (independent from whether it is a main or subordinate clause). Basically it means that the tense in an indirect quotation (he said that he was leaving) should be the same as in a direct quotation (he said, "I am leaving").

Examples:

Me jan-te kwo lu ve yao. — I knew what he would like.

May amiga ve skribi a me wo ta bin in saif. — My friend will write me about where he was last summer.

May amiga he skribi a me ke ta bin morbe bat nau ta sta hao snova. — My friend wrote to me that he had been ill but now he was well again.

Gela diki-te a nu suy nove kukla kel mog ofni e klosi okos. — The girl showed us her new doll which could open and close its eyes.

Me vidi-te ke lu zai lai e go-te versu lu. — I saw that he was coming (to me), and (I) went to meet him.

The _simple variant_ is when you don't mark verb tense at all but use words like ‘today’, ‘yesterday’ etc. and the context to convey the information about time of action. This variant is appropriate in speech.

Examples:

Preyeri me zai chu shop e miti may amiga. — The day before yesterday I was leaving the shop and met my friend.

Aftemanya me go fishi. — The day after tomorrow I'll go fishing.

Yeri pluvi e sedey bu pluvi. — Yesterday it rained, and today it isn't raining.

Laste mes me kan filma om polisyuan e lai-she mes me kan otre filma. — Last month I watched the film about a policeman, and next month I'll watch another film.

However, even in texts repeated past-tense marking is quite often superfluous, e. g., in narrating a series of past events.

_**Example**_ (with a literal translation):

Se eventi mucho yar bak. Dwa jen zai go

This happens many years ago. Two men walk

along kamina e miti un jen kel porti un

along the road and meet a man who carries a

nangwa.

pumpkin.

Li lai a ta, shwo:

They come to him and say:

— Hey! Kwo es sub yur bracha?

— Hey! What is it under your arm?

## Transitivity

The prefix “fa” (“to get, to become”) may serve as an intransitivity marker:

astoni — “to astonish”  
fa-astoni — “to be (become) astonished”

The causative prefix “mah” may serve as a transitivity marker:

lwo — “ to fall”  
mah-lwo — “to drop, let fall”

Many verbs in LdP may be intransitive and transitive in the same form, the same as the English verbs, for example ‘begin’ (‘to begin something’ vs ‘the film begins’) and ‘develop’ (‘to develop a theory’ vs ‘to develop into a nice personality’). Usually, if the verb is followed by an object, the verb is transitive, otherwise it is not:

me begin gun — I begin to work  
kino begin — the cinema begins

If ambiguity may arise, one can use the prefixes “fa” and “mah”.

## Participles with _\-ney_

Passive participle is marked with "-ney":

pi-ney akwa — the drunk water.

If you want to say that the water is being drunk, add "zai":

zai-pi-ney akwa — the water that is being drunk.

With intransitive verbs -ney is a past active participle marker:

apari-ney jen — the person that has appeared

morti-ney jen — the dead person

With some verbs both meanings are possible:

adapti-ney — adapted (either “that has become adapted” or “that has been adapted”).

To specify the exact meaning, if needed, use transitivity markers:

fa-adapti-ney — that has become adapted

adaptisi-ney — that has been adapted.

## The passive of state

The passive of state is formed by "bi" and "verb+ney"; it indicates a state as a result of a finished process:

Olo es yo shwo-ney, ye nixa fo shwo pyu. — Everything has already been said; there's nothing more to say.

Toy auto bin kupi-ney char yar bak. — That car was bought 4 years ago.

## The passive of becoming

The passive of becoming, formed by the auxiliary verb ‘gei’ and verb, indicates an unfinished process:

Dwar gei ofni lentem. — The door is being opened slowly (=gets opened)

(_compare:_ dwar es ofni-ney — the door is opened).

To gei zwo. — That is being done (compare: to es zwo-ney — that is done).

Autos gei kupi kada dey. — Cars are bought every day.

The past tense is formed with ‘gei-te’; the future with ‘ve gei’:

Se gei-te zwo tak e to ve gei zwo otrem. — This was (being) done so, and that will be (being) done otherwise.

## Verb doubling

This expresses that an action takes some time or is repeated many times. There may also be a connotation of certain ease and lack of constraint :

Nu shwo-shwo ba idyen. — Let's talk (chat) a little.

Nau treba kan-kan atenta-nem. — Now you should look carefully (keep an eye on something).

Treba dumi-dumi idyen. — One should think a little.

Kwo yu zwo-zwo? — What are you doing now?

## The verb _"bi"_ (to be)

This is an exceptional verb. It has the main form "bi", the present tense form "es", and the past tense form "bin".

•   "Es" does not need a subject in clauses like

Es hao. — This (it) is good.

Bu es posible. — This (it) is not possible.

•   In aphoristic sayings the link-verb ‘es’ might be dropped:

Tu shwo fasile, tu zwo mushkile. — To say is easy, to do is difficult.

Char gamba hao, dwa gamba buhao. — Four legs good, two legs bad.

## The infinitive and the infinitive particle _"tu"_

The infinitive particle **tu** is used when the infinitive has a meaning close to that of a noun (substantivization):

Tu shwo veritaa es hao. — To tell the truth is good.

Tu begin es lo zuy mushkile. — To begin is the most difficult thing.

Tu chi fish es hao fo sanitaa. — To eat fish is good for health.

Tu pluvi es muhim fo rekola. — Raining is important for the crop.

•   If the infinitive is placed after another verb, "tu" is not used:

Ta pri chi masu. — He likes to eat beef.

Me wud yao lagi sub surya nau. — I would like to lie under the sun now.

Me nadi vidi yu sun. — I hope to see you soon.

Oli jen mus gun. — All people must work.

Sempre gai samaji lo shefe. — One should always understand the most important thing.

Lu pregi-te pi. — He asked to drink.

Ela fogeti-te klefi dwar. — She forgot to lock the door.

Stopi shwo! — Stop talking!

•   In cases where the infinitive completes the meaning of a noun or adjective, it uses the same preposition as a noun would — though that preposition may differ from its English equivalent:

mogsa de lopi longtaim — the ability to run for a long time (=mogsa de longtaim-ney loping)

Lu es tro fatigi-ney fo go. — He is too tired to go. (=Lu es tro fatigi-ney fo going.)

Lu es fatigi-ney por go. — He is tired of walking. (=Lu es fatigi-ney por going.)

kitaba fo lekti — a book to read (=kitaba fo lekting)

Ob yu es tayar fo go? — Are you ready to go? (=Ob yu es tayar fo going?)

Es taim fo samaji to. — It is time to understand this. (=Es taim fo samaja)

Sembli ke problema fo diskusi yok. — It seems that there are no problems to discuss. (=Sembli ke problema fo diskusa yok.)

Ela go-te a basar fo kupi yabla. — She went to the market to buy apples.

Ela afsosi por kupi grin yabla. — She is sorry to have bought green apples.

Me joi al vidi yu. — I am glad to see you.

Me he lai por vidi luma in yur winda. — I came because of seeing light in your windows.

•   In subordinate clauses after the relative words "ob", "wo", "komo", etc., the infinitive is used without "tu":

Ela he findi plasa wo kupi hwan yabla. — She found a place (where) to buy yellow apples.

Me bu es serte ob go adar o bu go. — I am not sure whether to go there or not.

Lu jan komo zwo to. — He knows how to do it.

•   The particle "tu" may be used to mark the infinitive group:

Lu he wadi a me tu bringi un interes-ney jurnal. — He promised me to bring an interesting magazine.

(_But:_ Lu he wadi bringi un interes-ney jurnal a me).

Bu es fasile, tu begin rasmi in may yash. — It is not easy to take up drawing at my age.

## The verb _"ye"_ (there is)

The verb **ye** means "there is":

In shamba ye mucho stula. — In the room there are many chairs.

Stula dar ye. — There are chairs there.

The negative meaning (absence of something) is expressed through "bu ye" or **yok** (not available). The latter is placed after the object under discussion:

Bu ye stula in shamba. — There are no chairs in the room.

Stula in shamba yok. — There are no chairs in the room.

Mani ye-bu-ye? — Is there any money (to use)?

Mani yok. — No money available.

## The helping verb _"fai"_

It has the general meaning ‘to do, to perform an action’ and is used in combination with nouns and adverbs:

fai kwesta — to make (ask) a question

fai kasam — to make (take) a vow

fai fiasko — to not succeed

fai interes om koysa — to take an interest in something

fai bak! — may mean "set back" or "throw back!" etc.

fai avan! — may mean "throw forward!" etc.

As distinct from ‘zwo’ (to do, to make) ‘fai’ is a helping verb and may be used only in combinations, so “Do it!” is “Zwo to!”

In speech the combination ‘fai+noun’ may sometimes replace verbs that you cannot remember. In such a case ‘fai’ means ‘to use the object in some usual way, to act in usual way in connection with the object’:

fai kitaba — to read a book

fai kama — to sleep or lie on a bed

fai kaval — to ride a horse

fai gitara — to play guitar

fai kino — to watch a cinema or to go to the cinema

fai (defai) butas — to lace (unlace) shoes.

pai kreki nuta — to (succesfully) crack the nut

pai ofni ken — to open can (at last)
